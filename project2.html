          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>The motivation behind this project was to be able to create a dashboard where information about the 311 calls made in Cincinnati in 2022 could be viewed.</p>
          <p>You may be wondering, what is 311? 311 is the number used for all non-emergencies, whether you need police for a non-emergency issue, or for any service provided by the City. On the other hand, 911 is for medical, fire, and police emergencies only. <a href="https://www.cincinnati-oh.gov/ecc/about-ecc/311/#:~:text=What%20is%20the%20difference%20between,fire%2C%20and%20police%20emergencies%20only." target="_blank">Source: https://www.cincinnati-oh.gov/</a></p>
          <p>Our visualization specifically allows users to visualize where calls are being made, what day of the week most calls are made, what zipcode of Cincinnati calls are made from, what type of calls are made, the change in the number of calls made per day over time, and the number of days between a call issue being created and when it is closed.</p>

          <h2>The Data</h2>
          <p>The data was sourced from <a href="https://data.cincinnati-oh.gov/Thriving-Neighborhoods/Cincinnati-311-Non-Emergency-Service-Requests/4cjh-bm8b" target="_blank">the City of Cincinnati's public dataset website</a>. This website is maintained by the City of Cincinnati, allowing the public to interact with the data collected - government transparency is an important issue in civics. Although there are many years of data included in this dataset, we reduced our scope to just 2022, as required in our project. Information about each data column could also be found on the page.</p>
          <p>TODO MAY NEED TO MOVE THIS TO COMPONENTS SECTION When it came to grouping data from the status code (used in the map), we used the following <a href="https://cagis.hamilton-co.org/311/" target="_blank">website used for submitting 311 requests online</a> to create our custom categories. Some status codes fit into multiple categories - so we had to use our best judgement to decide what goes where.</p>
     
          <h2>Visualization Components</h2>
          <h4>Map</h4>
          <p>TODO don't feel like explaining rn
            design explanation for documentation: describe the colors you selected for these options and why you selected them, referencing whether the data is nominal, ordinal, quantitative, etc. and whether the color scheme is monochromatic, diverging, or categorical.

          <p>Users can also filter other data by clicking on a bar. To remove the filter, the user can click again on the bar. This filter also works when the user clicks on the x-axis label for the bar.</p>

          <h4>Timeline - Calls over time</h4>
          <h5>View of the data</h5>
          <p>This cluster of components all work together to show time series data to the user. The first component is the <a href="https://gramener.github.io/visual-vocabulary-vega/#/Change-over-Time/" target="_blank">calendar heatmap</a>. What I like about this visualization is that you can see different trends at once. For example, by focusing on the rows, I can see that Sundays and Saturdays have the least calls. This makes sense - for a non-emergency line, more people are likely to make calls during the workweek about a traffic light being down or water pipe leak.</p>
          <p>Another insight the user can gain is being able to see when the most calls were made in the whole year, by looking for the darkest rectangle in the heatmap. This looks to be 2/23/2022 with 745 calls.</p>
          <p>We can also see an abnormally light day surrounded by dark days in November. By hovering on the light day, we can see that it was Thanksgiving Day - a holiday so not many people would make calls.</p>
          
          <p><br/><br/>The other component is the line chart of the time series data with calls made over the year. WHile it may be a boring way to display information, it is something that users are used to viewing and analyzing. We can confirm that the highest call count made in 2022 was 745 calls.</p>
          <p>The user can also gain insight on whether calls increase over the year. There is no obvious trend to indicate that is true.</p>

          <h5>UI/Interactions</h5>
          <p>Users can hover over each rectangle on the calendar heatmap to view more specific data (exact call count and date) for each rectangle.</p>
          <p>Users can hover over points on the line chart to view more specific data (exact call count) for each point.</p>
          <p>TODO insert screenshots</p>


          <h4>Histogram - Days Between Call Received and Issue Updated</h4>
          <h5>View of the data</h5>
          <p>TODO insert screenshots</p>
          <h5>UI/Interactions</h5>
          <p>Users can hover over each bar to view more specific data (number of days to resolution and exact call count) for each bar.</p>
          <p>Users can gain insight on the data by seeing that most calls get resolved within 5 days. Users can also see that the longest time it takes to resolve an issue is around 55 days.</p>



          <h2>Sketching and Design Justifications</h2>
          <p>TODO</p>



          <h2>Insights</h2>
          <p>Using the timeline, we can also see a pattern - from 1/25/2022 to 2/4/2022, it is much lighter (meaning less calls were made). While I don't see anything in the news that may explain the lack of calls, the user could maybe consider the scenario that perhaps the 311 call system was down during this period. While we can't know for sure, it is something that the user may be interested in diving further.</p>
          <p>TODO - 1 section on what your application enables you to discover: Present some findings you arrive at with your application. </p>


          <h2>Process</h2>
          <h5>Libraries used</h5>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="https://d3js.org" target="_blank">D3.js</a> - JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/d3-scale-chromatic" target="_blank">d3-scale-chromatic</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://leaflet.github.io/Leaflet.draw/docs/leaflet-draw-latest.html" target="_blank">Leaflet-Draw</a> - Javascript library for map data</li>
          </ul>
          <p>We also used map backgrounds from Stamen, OpenStreetMap, and Stadia Maps. </p>
          <p>Our code was structured with our classes having initVis(), updateVis(), and renderVis() functions to make re-rendering vizzes easier.</p>
          <p>TODO - 1 section on your process- what libraries did you use?  How did you structure your code?  How can you access it and run it?  Link to your code (and the live application, if it is deployed online). 
          </p>



          <h2>Demo Video</h2>
          <p>TODO - Include a 2-3 minute demo video, showing your application in action.  The easiest way to record this is with a screen capture tool, which also captures audio- such as Quicktime.  Use a voiceover or video captions to explain your application.  Demo videos should be sufficient on their own, but can reference your documentation.  Include the name of the project, your name, the project components, and how your application works.  You can present it on your webpage or on youtube, but linked on your webpage. 
          </p>

          <h2>Division of work</h2>
          <p>TODO - This time, document who on your team did which component of the project.  Ex.  If someone worked on the data, and on bar charts, list their effort on these components.
