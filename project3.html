            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>As fans of the show <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender" target="_blank">Avatar: The Last Airbender</a>, my team decided to delve deeper into the realm of the Fire Nation's reign. Users can view information about which bender type talks the most in the show, what the main characters were saying, who talked to who, and the number of episodes the characters appeared in, in one simple visualization. We used plenty of imagery from the show to make it even easier for fans to navigate.</p>

            <h2><br/><br/>The Data</h2>
            <p>Our team sourced the data using <a href="https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Avatar_Wiki:Transcripts" target="_blank">this page compiling all the scripts on the Avatar Fandom wiki</a>, creating a custom script to parse all the data.</p>
            <p><a href="https://github.com/corncob567/Avatar-TV-Time/blob/main/notebooks/avatar_scapper.py" target="_blank">Our scraper file can be viewed here</a> - to summarize, the scraper was written in Python to scrape each transcript on the page previously mentioned. Each page features an html table of the whole script, with the character and what they said, along with extraneous information such as stage instructions. An http request was made to each page to grab the contents of the page body. Each episode transcript was saved into a Pandas Dataframe with season, episode, character, and dialog, added in the order of the transcript.</p>
            <p>The data was saved to a csv file containing every dataframe row, <a href="https://github.com/corncob567/Avatar-TV-Time/blob/main/data/avatar_transcripts.csv" target="_blank">viewawble here</a>.</p>

            <!--
            1 section on the visualization components: Explain each view of the data, the GUI, etc.  Explain how you can interact with your application, and how the views update in response to these interactions. 
            Include design sketches and design justifications 
            1 section on what your application enables you to discover: Present some findings you arrive at with your application.  Include screen shots to illustrate.
            1 section on your process- what libraries did you use?  How did you structure your code?  How can you access it and run it?  Link to your code (and the live application, if it is deployed online). 
            Include a 2-3 minute demo video, showing your application in action.  The easiest way to record this is with a screen capture tool, which also captures audio- such as Quicktime.  Use a voiceover or video captions to explain your application.  Demo videos should be sufficient on their own, but can reference your documentation.  Include the name of the project, your name, the project components, and how your application works.  You can present it on your webpage or on youtube, but linked on your webpage. 
            Document who on your team did which component of the project.  Ex.  If someone worked on the data, and on bar charts, list their effort on these components.  -->
