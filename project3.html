            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>As fans of the show <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender" target="_blank">Avatar: The Last Airbender</a>, my team decided to delve deeper into the realm of the Fire Nation's reign. Users can view information about which bender type talks the most in the show, what the main characters were saying, who talked to who, and the number of episodes the characters appeared in, in one simple visualization. We used plenty of imagery from the show to make it even easier for fans to navigate.</p>

            <h2><br/><br/>The Data</h2>
            <p>Our team sourced the data using <a href="https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Avatar_Wiki:Transcripts" target="_blank">this page compiling all the scripts on the Avatar Fandom wiki</a>, creating a custom script to parse all the data.</p>
            <p><a href="https://github.com/corncob567/Avatar-TV-Time/blob/main/notebooks/avatar_scapper.py" target="_blank">Our scraper file can be viewed here</a> - to summarize, the scraper was written in Python to scrape each transcript on the page previously mentioned. Each page features an html table of the whole script, with the character and what they said, along with extraneous information such as stage instructions. An http request was made to each page to grab the contents of the page body. Each episode transcript was saved into a Pandas Dataframe with season, episode, character, and dialog, added in the order of the transcript.</p>
            <p>The data was saved to a csv file containing every dataframe row, <a href="https://github.com/corncob567/Avatar-TV-Time/blob/main/data/avatar_transcripts.csv" target="_blank">viewawble here</a>.</p>

                    <p><br/><br/>We wanted to focus on the unique aspects of our show - benders are an easy to understand yet unique part of the show. We thought we could make a simple visualization with the benders and how often they speak.</p>
                    <p>With our bender's piechart, we decided on keeping the color scheme of the actual show - red for firebenders, yellow for airbenders, etc. We kept this color scheme consistent across our visualization.</p>
                    <p>Specifically earth - #063, water - #039, fire - #e55, air - #FF9900, nonbender - #9932cc</p>

                    <p><br/><br/>Another option we came up with for our show-specific visualization is to focus on the cabbage man, an iconic character whose cabbages are always distroyed.</p>
                    <p>I created a mockup of what that viz would look like - mentions of cabbages in each episode graphed in a table, and BANs to show the user how many times cabbages are mentioned and specifically the phrase "My Cabbages!" is mentioned.</p>
                    <p>However, this would have disrupted the theme of our visualization and we decided that having the bender's piechart was more useful both to fans and non-fans, as well as easier to accomplish in our limited time.</p>

                <div class="col">
                  <p><br/><br/>The default view of the table allows the user to view each episode from each season and understand who was talking and how many words they spoke. Users can scroll down the table to view all the information.</p>

                  <p><br/><br/>When a character is selected, the table updates to show only the episodes in which they appeared. The reason why we placed this next to the word cloud is because the word cloud will also update - this will be covered later.</p>
                  <p>If one of the main characters is selected, a blurb also shows of their most said phrases - this was manually found using <a href="https://www.online-utility.org/text/analyzer.jsp">this word text analysis website</a>, allowing us to find key phrases after pasting in all of the character's lines.</p>

                    <p><br/><br/>The mockup was created while thinking about the requirements of what we had to show. The word cloud would show the words spoken by character but we still needed a way to be able to view the character's lines by season and episode. </p>
                    <p>The popup is the only way users can get the full lines spoken by the characters, so including it added another dimension of data to our visualization.</p>
