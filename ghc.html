                <p>If you're a woman/nonbinary in tech reading this, hopefully you already know about GHC (Grace Hopper Celebration).
                    It's an amazing conference for networking and career development (not to mention all the free swag if you're 
                    lucky enough to attend in-person!).

                <h3>How to prepare (In-Person & Remote)</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>UPLOAD YOUR RESUME TO THE ANITA B DATABASE</li>
                    <p>THIS IS SO IMPORTANT THAT IT IS IN ALL UPPERCASE LOL. Many companies will p</p>
                    <li>Update your resume!</li>
                    <p>Make sure you put your most recent projects, internships, awards, etc.</p>
                    <li>Update your website!</li>
                    <p>I put my website link on my resume, and it is nice to have things to show if interviewers or recruiters ask about projects!</p>
                    <li>Update your LinkedIn!</li>
                    <p>Many people who attend GHC will add "#GHC23" or whatever year to their LinkedIn headline. It makes it easy to connect with other attendees and companies will also be active on LinkedIn (so connect with them there too!).</p>
                    <li>Practice your pitch</li>
                    <p>I know this is cliche, but you need to be able to pitch yourself confidently and effectively. Try to find one thing about the recruiter that you can relate to or talk about something other than internships/careers! I found that my most meaningful connections came from meeting people while in line to take pics in front of the GHC sign or by talking about a personal aspect of my life.</p>

                <h3>How to pack (In-Person)</h3>
                <p>Here is a list of items to bring to GHC - this is basically copy and pasted from my own packing list</p>
                <p>Because GHC has been hosted at the Orlando Conference Center (not anymore after GHC 2023 - read about the change here),
                    it's typically pretty hot. At the same time, the dress code is business casual (especially 
                    if you're participating in the career fair). This makes it tough to stay cool, especially between the shuttles and
                    hotels.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>50+ resumes</li>
                    <p>I have had friends tell me to bring 100 but I think 50 is enough, especially since many companies have mobile applications</p>
                    <li>Padfolio</li>
                    <p>For that extra professional touch</p>
                    <li>Passport/ID</li>
                    <li>Wallet</li>
                    <li>Phone and charger</li>
                    <li>Powerbank</li>
                    <li>Airpods/headphones</li>
                    <li>Laptop and charger</li>
                    <li>Masks</li>
                    <li>Toiletries - toothpaste, toothbrush, deoderant, makeup, hand sanitizer</li>
                    <li>Blazer</li>
                    <li>4 business casual tops</li>
                    <li>3 nicer shirts</li>
                    <li>Black jeans</li>

                <h3>How to make the most of GHC</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Hit the career fair</li>
                    <p>If you are a senior about to graduate, it is in your best interest to hit all the booths you are interested in and network. Because I was able to secure my full-time offer at GHC my senior year, I was able to go the rest of my year not having to worry about graduating with no job. I got to enjoy my senior year focusing on both classes and my friends.</p>
                    <li>Don't be afraid to make friends</li>
                    <p>Connections can come from everywhere. The best thing about GHC is that there are so many knowledgable, succesful, and aspirational women at this conference.</p>
