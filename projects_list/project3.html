            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>As fans of the show <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender" target="_blank">Avatar: The Last Airbender</a>, my team decided to delve deeper into the realm of the Fire Nation's reign. Users can view information about which bender type talks the most in the show, what the main characters were saying, who talked to who, and the number of episodes the characters appeared in, in one simple visualization. We used plenty of imagery from the show to make it even easier for fans to navigate.</p>

            <h2><br/><br/>The Data</h2>
            <p>Our team sourced the data using <a href="https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Avatar_Wiki:Transcripts" target="_blank">this page compiling all the scripts on the Avatar Fandom wiki</a>, creating a custom script to parse all the data.</p>
            <p><a href="https://github.com/corncob567/Avatar-TV-Time/blob/main/notebooks/avatar_scapper.py" target="_blank">Our scraper file can be viewed here</a> - to summarize, the scraper was written in Python to scrape each transcript on the page previously mentioned. Each page features an html table of the whole script, with the character and what they said, along with extraneous information such as stage instructions. An http request was made to each page to grab the contents of the page body. Each episode transcript was saved into a Pandas Dataframe with season, episode, character, and dialog, added in the order of the transcript.</p>
            <p>The data was saved to a csv file containing every dataframe row, <a href="https://github.com/corncob567/Avatar-TV-Time/blob/main/data/avatar_transcripts.csv" target="_blank">viewable here</a>.</p>

                  <p><br/><br/>One of the main design decisions we made has to do with the character select bar on the left side of the screen. When we were considering different ways to filter by character, we didn't want to do a simple dropdown button. We took inspiration from the Discord server bar to come up with our simple yet intuitive design.</p>
                  <p>The filtering shows at the top of the screen, and can be reset using the button at the bottom of the screen. We are able to filter by season/episode and character.</p>

                    <p><br/><br/>We wanted to focus on the unique aspects of our show - benders are an easy to understand yet unique part of the show. We thought we could make a simple visualization with the benders and how often they speak.</p>
                    <p>With our bender's piechart, we decided on keeping the color scheme of the actual show - red for firebenders, yellow for airbenders, etc. We kept this color scheme consistent across our visualization.</p>
                    <p>Specifically earth - #063, water - #039, fire - #e55, air - #FF9900, nonbender - #9932cc</p>

                    <p><br/><br/>Another option we came up with for our show-specific visualization is to focus on the cabbage man, an iconic character whose cabbages are always destroyed.</p>
                    <p>I created a mockup of what that viz would look like - mentions of cabbages in each episode graphed in a table, and BANs to show the user how many times cabbages are mentioned and specifically the phrase "My Cabbages!" is mentioned.</p>
                    <p>However, this would have disrupted the theme of our visualization and we decided that having the bender's piechart was more useful both to fans and non-fans, as well as easier to accomplish in our limited time.</p>

                  <p>If one of the main characters is selected, a blurb also shows of their most said phrases - this was manually found using <a href="https://www.online-utility.org/text/analyzer.jsp">this word text analysis website</a>, allowing us to find key phrases after pasting in all of the character's lines.</p>

                    <p><br/><br/>The mockup was created while thinking about the requirements of what we had to show. The word cloud would show the words spoken by character but we still needed a way to be able to view the character's lines by season and episode. </p>
                    <p>The popup is the only way users can get the full lines spoken by the characters, so including it added another dimension of data to our visualization.</p>

                  <p><br/><br/>The chord diagram is static regardless of the filters applied. This is not something we intended, but we were unable to get the chords properly re-rendering when filters were applied. Essentially, it shows how often each of the main characters refers to another main character by name. Hovering over each arc shows a tooltip showing exactly what the number of references comes out to be between those two main characters.</p>
                  <p>Viewers will notice very strong connections between Aang, Katara, and Sokka, as well as between Zuko and Iroh (who travel together throughout nearly all of the series). We included this visualization because we believe it highlights the strength of relationships or bonds between characters effectively.</p>

                    <p><br/><br/>This mockup was our first idea of what the barchart woud look like. We ended up having to change some of the design, such as the placement of the bender symbols. While we wanted it to be inside the bar itself, some bars were too small to contain the symbol. Therefore, we put it near the tick instead, where there would be enough space. The coloring scheme was based on the nationality of the character (Fire, Water, Earth, Air). This is similar to the pie chart, with the same color scheme (specifically earth - #063, water - #039, fire - #e55, air - #FF9900, non-national - #9932cc).</p>
                    <p>We also wanted to have the number of words spoken on the bar of the barchart, but we decided that would be confusing to the user - whether the barchart was showing number of appearances or words spoken. We placed that information in the tooltip with a description that would make sense.</p>
