        <p>In Oct. of 2021, I was chosen as the Top 10 Homecoming Queen Nominee at UC. This was an
            exciting experience for me, as I was never huge into school spirit - but the theme of
            year was "Thy Loyal Children", which I felt fit me well as the child of two UC educators.

    Hi, I'm Lina Kaval, a fifth year computer science (through the College of Engineering and 
    Applied Sciences) and University Honors student at the University of Cincinnati. â€‹I am also
     working towards a certificate Business Analytics through the Lindner College of Business.
      After experiencing my first year at UC, I felt that Big Data and software development 
      are my main interests, mirrored in my educational decisions. I experienced my first coop 
      in the fall of 2019 at The Lubrizol Corporation and returned for the summer 2020 semester.
       I have also worked at Ellington Management Group as a Data Engineering Co-op in the Spring
        2021 and Summer 2021 semesters. I currently work at MZA Associates Corporation as a Web 
        Developer Coop. I am a proud alumna of the Lakota East High School Class of 2018. I like
         to sing, dance, and learn about new technology.
           My interest in computer science started when I took Computer Science 1 in my sophomore
            year of high school. Although I didn't immediately excel in the class, I enjoyed the
             challenges and having to problem solve. However, after taking Computer Science 2 
             and Advanced Placement (AP) Computer Science A, I definitely knew that programming
              was something I wanted to pursue. I even managed to get a 5 on the AP exam. Within
               computer science, I am interested in data science, programming, web development
                and project management. I also want to help girls like me, who may not have 
                thought about computer science as a career, have the opportunity to discover
                 computer science.
           My other interests stem from my background as the daughter of two immigrants. 
           I am half Japanese, half Turkish, and this has helped me be accepting towards other 
           people of other cultures and backgrounds. This has made me want to explore other 
           cultures and ideas. My next travel plan is Bali, Indonesia over winter break 2022 
           and Turkey during spring break of 2023.</div> -->
