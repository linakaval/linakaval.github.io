        <p>Hi, I'm Lina Kaval, a soon-to-be graduate in computer science (through the <a href="https://ceas.uc.edu/" target="_blank">College of Engineering and 
          Applied Science</a>) and business analytics student at the University of Cincinnati.  

          <br/><br/>Through my various co-op experiences, I have experienced working as a Security Operations Center analyst,
          web developer, and data engineer. I am very excited to be joining Prudential as an Infrasture Developer 
          following my graduation from the University of Cincinnati.  

          <br/><br/>My interest in computer science was fostered through the help of many educators. I'd like to shout them out here,
          as one day I would also like to become an educator.  

          <br/><br/>Mr. McKain - the person who taught me all the fundamentals of programming and computer science. Although some 
          concepts took me a while to pick up, Mr. McKain's steady mentorship encouraged me to continue working towards
          understanding computer science and realizing that it was the thing I wanted to pursue.

          <br/><br/>Dr. Montjoy - despite only being in his class for one semester, he made a big impact on my freshman year. With his
          help, I was able to attend a workshop at Cornell University, which exposed me to research and my goal of one day
          working towards a Ph.D.

          <br/><br/>Dr. McFall - funny enough, I never took Dr. McFall's class. I worked as his TA for four semesters - during this time,
          Dr. McFall was my greatest mentor, encouraging me to grow both in my studies and as a person.

          <br/><br/>Badri - an unlikely ally, Badri had a big impact on my senior year of studies. While his class may be the most
          difficult computer science class I took, the concepts we learned were strangely fun. Understanding finite starte
          machines and turing machines made me feel like I understood how we went from primitive machiens to modern-day computers.
          

          <br/><br/>Outside of tech, my interests are traveling, music, and bringing joy to the people around me.</p>
