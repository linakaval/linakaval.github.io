        <p></br>Hi, I'm Lina Kaval, a graduate of the University of Cincinnati, with a B.S. in Computer Science (through the <a href="https://ceas.uc.edu/" target="_blank">College of Engineering and 
          Applied Science</a>) and a certificate in Business Analytics. I am currently an Associate Infrastructure Developer at Prudential Financial, based in Newark, NJ. 

          <br/><br/>Through my various co-op experiences, I have worked as a Security Operations Center analyst,
          web developer, and data engineer. Now I am focusing on learning cloud technologies like AWS to support my work in the Identity and
          Access Management space.  

          <br/><br/>My interest in computer science was fostered with the help of many educators. I'd like to give them a shoutout here,
          as one day I would also like to become an educator.  

          <br/><br/>Mr. McKain - the person who taught me all the fundamentals of programming and computer science. Although some 
          concepts took me a while to grasp, Mr. McKain's steady mentorship encouraged me to continue working towards
          understanding computer science and realizing that it was the field I wanted to pursue.

          <br/><br/>Dr. Montjoy - despite only being in his class for one semester, he made a big impact on my freshman year. With his
          help, I was able to attend a workshop at Cornell University, which exposed me to research and fueled my goal of one day
          working towards a Ph.D.

          <br/><br/>Dr. McFall - funny enough, I never took Dr. McFall's class. I worked as his TA for four semesters. During this time,
          Dr. McFall was my greatest mentor, encouraging me to grow both in my studies and as a person.

          <br/><br/>Badri - an unlikely ally, Badri had a significant impact on my senior year of studies. While his class may have been
          the most challenging computer science class I took, the concepts we learned were strangely fun. Understanding finite state
          machines and Turing machines made me feel like I understood how we progressed from primitive machines to modern-day computers.
          

          <br/><br/>Outside of tech, my interests include traveling, music, and bringing joy to the people around me.</p>
